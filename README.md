## Artifacts for the ACSAC 2024 paper titled "Rust for Linux: Understanding the Security Impact of Rust in the Linux Kernel"

We have collected the set of Linux kernel CVEs from the device driver code
(under the ./drivers subtree of the kernel tree) from the CVE database from
four years (2020 to 2024).

The linked [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1iiuwJ_JnUQYtACTi-ZmZYcFW8ow9PGIjCU5_nMhgQ/edit?usp=sharing)
contains the list of CVEs for each year, our classification methodology
(Section 3 of the paper) and the consolidated CVE list (Table 2).

_Note: The sheet is shared as read-only for the public and you do not need to
sign-in to download the sheet_.
